# IP Finder Application

IP Finder is a simple Java application built using Swing UI that allows users to input a domain name and get its corresponding IP address. 
This project uses the Java Networking API to resolve domain names and retrieve the associated IP address.

##Features:
 - User-friendly Interface: The application is built with Swing UI, providing a clean and simple graphical interface for users to interact with.
 - Domain Name Resolution: Users can enter any domain name (e.g., www.google.com), and the application will resolve it to its corresponding IP address.
 - Error Handling: If an invalid domain name is entered or an error occurs during the lookup process, the application will display a helpful error message.

##Technologies Used:
 - Java 8+: The core language for building the application.
 - Swing: A Java GUI toolkit used for creating the graphical user interface (UI).
 - Java Networking API: Used to resolve domain names into IP addresses using the InetAddress.getByName() method.
